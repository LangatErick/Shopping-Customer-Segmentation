# PROJECT - MACHINE LEARNING
- In this project, I have tried to demonstrate the use of Machine Learning in businesses for profit enhancement.

- Unsupervised Learning(Clustering) is used to find the hidden data patterns or structures that an organization can use (like malls, shopping complexes, etc) to target the right audience and increase profit margin.

- Also, this approach allows organizations to spend less on advertisements by choosing the right audience and then advertising.

* Annual Income(k$) - Annual income of the customer in k$
